# Statistical Inference
## Define Sample Space
Sample Space is ralated to experiment. So we hava to define experiment first.
- Toss a coin
- Toss a dice
- Get a person on the street, and ask his preference to president

We can tell, we have to use statement words to describe our experiment which includes our intensions and behaviours of interest.

And all the possible outcomes to experiment will become the **sample space**, and it's a set.
- {H, T} H: head, T: tail
- {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- {thumbup, thumbdown}

**In this book, we dont talk too much about population, so this is why we say experiment, we say sample space.**

## Countable and Uncountable
**Conclusion:** uncountable is much better, cuz we can use mature and powerful mathematical methods to deal with problems. Like intergration, derivatives and so on.
- Countable: if every element in sample space has 1-1 corresponding in **integers**. Then this sample space is countable
- Uncountable: otherwise

A controversial but very intuitive example: Possion variable X, X can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Even the number of elements is infinite, it's still countable, cuz it go wide, not deep: every element can have a corresponding element to interger set Z.
